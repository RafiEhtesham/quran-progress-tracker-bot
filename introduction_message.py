Welcome to the **Quran Quest**!

A friendly community where we will share our progress in reading the Quran and motivate each other to read more everyday.

Here is how you can participate in the Quran Quest:

-> Use the "/entry" command to enter your progress in reading the Quran.
   Enter what para you have reached and also what quarter you are in.
   If you have finished a para, enter 0 in the quarter.
   You don't have to be exact about what quarter you are in, just give an estimate.(0-3)
   Your entry will be shown as a public message.
   It might just be a nudge for someone else to read more from the Quran.

-> Use the "/leaderboard" command to see the leaderboard of the Quran Quest.
   This will show the progress of all the members in the server.
   Compete with your friends, provoke them to read more and be on top of the leaderboard!

Narrated by Ahmad, al-Tabaraani, and al-Haakim,   
The prophet (peace and blessing be upon) said:
"Fasting and the Qur'an will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say, 'O Lord, I deprived him of food and desires during the day, so let me intercede for him.' The Qur'an will say, 'O Lord I deprived him of his sleep at night, so let me intercede for him.' Then they will both intercede for him."
